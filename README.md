### Intel 8080 Emulator

This repository contains an Intel 8080 emulator for the Atari 130XE written in 6502 assembly.

The Makefile builds an overlay that is meant to be run on top of CP/M-65.
It translates all 8080 BIOS calls to their CP/M-65 equivalents. BDOS and CCP
run "natively" on the 8080 emulation.
The overlay loader is currently at https://github.com/ivop/cpm65/tree/8080ovl.

To assembly 8080.s into a binary you need the MADS Assembler which can be
found here: https://github.com/tebe6502/Mad-Assembler/ 

#### Possible Future work

##### Source to source translator

We could use the instruction emulation code to implement a 8080 to 6502
source to source translator. Each 8080 opcode is replaced by the
equivalent in 6502 instructions. We won't be using the extended memory
banks anymore, so memory access will also be faster. We do need a proper
(dis)assembly listing of the source program. One where data and code
is cleanly separated. Some constructs will need manual intervention,
like call 5 to access BDOS in CP/M or checks for the upper limit of the
TPA area by checking where BDOS starts. It has to be replaced by the CP/M-65
equivalent. After translation, the 6502 code could be run through a
peephole optimizer to remove redundant loads and stores. Another
possibility is to remove flag calculation code if the flags are changed
afterwards before they are evaluated by one of the jump instructions.

##### Dynamic recompiler

Right now, for a lot of instructions,
the overhead of the instruction dispatcher is huge.
For example, all MOV instructions, except when M is involved, are just
a single lda and a single sta in 6502 assembly.
Add to that at least 12 instructions for the instruction fetcher,
and it's obvious that that's a huge factor in slowing down the emulation.
It would be nice if multiple instructions could be executed after
eachother without the dispatcher slowing it down. However, the setup time
and maintaining a cache of recompiled instructions as to not having to
recompile them over and over again might become problematic and not
worth the effort.

#### Test suites

All four tests with the 6502 core are succesful!

The 8080 prototype core in C runs all validation sets correctly. Note that the BIOS handling might not have all the bugfixes the 6502 version got.
